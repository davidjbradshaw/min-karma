Minimal Karma Runner Setup

## Karma
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) is a JavaScript Test Runner, one of the most popular and friendliest for beginners.

> On the AngularJS team, we rely on testing and we always seek better tools to make our life easier. That's why we created
Karma - a test runner that fits all our needs.

## Why?
- Most setups are bloated with unnecessary options.
- Start clean and minimal and extend as you go.

## Features
- Minimal functional Karma config file.
- Minimal testing example.

## Install
Create new directory:
```sh
mkdir new-directory && cd new-directory
```
Install the package:
```sh
npm install min-karma --save
```
That's it.

## Getting started
Run your tests:
```sh
npm test
```
Now try to edit files inside `src` folder and see how karma is watching and updating your test results.

Enjoy!
